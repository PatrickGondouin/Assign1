<div><p> Rally at Leinster House Wednesday Oct 3rd @12:30-2pm<p>
<p> Trade unions, political parties, students’ unions, housing agencies & community and campaign groups have joined forces to demand action on the housing crisis.<p>
<p> Most workers now struggle to buy a home of their own as house prices have spiralled beyond the reach of those on low and average incomes.<p>
<p> It is a key issue for women as our rate of female homelessnessis now double that of other EU states and more than 60% of homeless families are headed by lone parents, the majority of whomare women.<p>
<p>Meanwhile, housing waiting lists grow ever longer and homeless numbers are at record levels. Thousands are now crowded into unsuitable accommodation, with families forced to raise children in hotel rooms and other emergency dwellings.</p></div>
